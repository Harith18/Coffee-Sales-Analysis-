Coffee Sales Analysis Project Using SQL
I recently completed a data analytics project focused on analyzing coffee sales using SQL. This project aimed to provide actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and inventory management for a coffee shop chain.

Key Highlights:
Data Extraction and Transformation: Extracted sales data from multiple sources and performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to ensure data quality and consistency.
Sales Performance Analysis: Conducted a detailed analysis of sales performance across different regions, time periods, and product categories using complex SQL queries.
Customer Segmentation: Identified key customer segments based on purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing and personalized promotions.
Trend Identification: Analyzed seasonal trends and peak sales periods to optimize inventory and staffing levels.
Dashboard Creation: Created interactive dashboards using SQL to visualize key metrics and trends, providing stakeholders with easy-to-understand insights.
This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in improving business performance. I'm excited to leverage these insights to drive future projects and contribute to business success.
